## Overview on Tillage ##
1. Types of tillage:
	1. Primary Tillage
		1. Goes deep into the soil and breaks it down
		2. Brings lower soil over to the surface and surface soil below
			1. Brings the nutrients from lower soil to the top
			2. Mixes residue from previous crops with deeper soil
		3. Types of ploughs
			1. MB Plough
				1. Types:
					1. Delux
						1. Mechanical reversible
						2. Hydraulic reversible
					2. Super
			2. Disk Plough
			3. Chissel Plough
		4. Other attachments used:
			1. Cultivator
			2. Spading machine
			3. Power harrow
		5. Range: 6 inches to 12 inches
		6. Crop types: (whose roots go deep)
			1. Cotton
			2. Sugarcane
			3. Banana
			4. Corn
			5. Soybean
			6. Potato
	2. Secondary Tillage
		1. Requires finely breaking the soil
		2. Large clouds of soil are finely broken and levelled
			1. Sowing and germination will be good
		3. Types of tillers:
			1. Rotary tiller (beaks finely and levels the soil)
		4. Other types of attachments
			1. Cultivator
			2. Harrow
		5. Range: 6 incches to 7 inches

		3. Use case: If no cultivation has been done for a long time (4 years say)
	4. Zero Tillage
		1. Tillage not required
		2. Use case: Wheat crop after harvesting paddy
			1. We can sow wheat without any ploughing
		3. Types of attachments
			1. Zero Till Seed Drill

## Laser Leveler ##
1. Requirement: Leveling can increase crop yield!
2. Techniques:
	1. Laser Leveler
		1. Trasmitter - can be mounted anywhere on the field
		2. Receiver - mounted on the leveler (on the bucket)
		3. Control Box - Receiver sends signal sent by transmitter ot the control box
			1. Controls wheels using hydraulic cylinders according to field level
				1. Maintains height of the bucket
		4. How to use it?
			1. First step: Plough the field using
				1. MB Plough OR
				2. Cultivator OR
				3. Rotary Tiller
			2. Second Step: Survey of the field (auto-survey mode)
				1. To know the highest and lowest points
				2. Needs covering as much of the field as possible
			3. Third Step: Run the leveler from higher point to lower point of the field
				1. Needs covering most of the field
		5. Advantages:
			1. Saves water, fuel, manure, fertilizer, and seeds
			
## Tractor Buying Guide ##

## Polyhouse ##
1. Challenges
	1. Increase in population and reduction in farm land size
	2. Unpredictable rain patterns and flooding or lack of rain at times
2. Solution: Polyhouse

		1. Or else reduced production
4. Structure
	1. Direction: east-west (for maximum sun-light)
		1. North-south is okay

	3. 6 1/2 meters height
	4. Top roofing: 200 microns polythene (top) + 50% shadenet (below)

		1. Retains CO2 at night (upto 5 times as compared to open field)
			1. Plants exhale CO2 at night and inhale O2
			2. Plants exhale O2 in the morning and inhale CO2 (CO2 retention at night helps in the morning)
	4. Need to open and close curtains (after 6 - 7 pm)
10. Fogger can be used to control temperature and humidity
